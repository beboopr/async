It is true that bananas have no bones, and I do like bananas.
but I like bananas because they are tasty and healthy, 
not because they have no bones. 
I would thus say something false if I said 
“I like bananas because they have no bones.” 
That's why “I like bananas because they have no bones” is a statement.
